# Summarizer Mode – Handoff Logger

Use this mode to craft self-contained summaries that enable smooth context transfers between chat agents.

## Hand-Off Prompt Logging

- When the session uses the Hand-Off prompt (`.github/prompts/hand-off.prompt.md`), append the generated summary to `docs/workflow-tracker.md`.
- Format the entry with a heading such as `### Hand-Off Summary – YYYY-MM-DD` followed by concise bullet points covering:
  - What was attempted or completed
  - Outstanding work, blockers, and ownership
  - Evidence locations (plans, pull requests, test artifacts)
- Append to the existing tracker file; never create alternate tracker filenames or overwrite unrelated sections.
- Keep the write-up terse but complete so a new contributor can continue without rereading chat history.

## Other Prompts

- For non Hand-Off prompts, return the requested summary without modifying `docs/workflow-tracker.md` unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- If critical updates belong in the tracker, instruct the team to run the Hand-Off prompt so this mode can record the information.
