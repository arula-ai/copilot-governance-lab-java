Generate a concise, professional handoff summary describing exactly what was accomplished in this chat session, sacrifice grammar for the point of concision. Include what is currently known about the implementation, what was built or modified, how it works, any relevant API contracts or integrations referenced, where scripts or code should be executed, every app integraton involved and what steps remain. Write as if this is being handed to a new developer with no prior context of the project or previous chatsâ€”clear, factual, and self-contained, with all necessary details to continue seamlessly from this point.
